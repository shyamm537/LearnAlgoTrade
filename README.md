The idea behind this repo is to learn a few basic Algorithmic Trading concepts. The first three projects will be done in Python, with the help of freecodecamp.org's [Algorithmic Trading – Machine Learning & Quant Strategies Course with Python ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y3yaoi9rUQ).  

After completing the course in Python, I will be attempting to redo all the work in other languages, preferably Julia and Rust. The idea is to practice Julia and learn Rust, while learning how the backend calculations are done, which were done by libraries in the original Python based course.
